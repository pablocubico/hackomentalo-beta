DEPRECATION WARNING: ** Notice: embed is deprecated. **
The use of .embed method on a Serializer will be soon removed, as this should have a global scope and not a class scope.
Please use the global .setup method instead:
ActiveModel::Serializer.setup do |config|
  config.embed = :ids
  config.embed_in_root = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: ** Notice: embed is deprecated. **
The use of .embed method on a Serializer will be soon removed, as this should have a global scope and not a class scope.
Please use the global .setup method instead:
ActiveModel::Serializer.setup do |config|
  config.embed = :ids

DEPRECATION WARNING: ** Notice: embed is deprecated. **
The use of .embed method on a Serializer will be soon removed, as this should have a global scope and not a class scope.
Please use the global .setup method instead:
ActiveModel::Serializer.setup do |config|
  config.embed = :ids
  config.embed_in_root = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: ** Notice: embed is deprecated. **
The use of .embed method on a Serializer will be soon removed, as this should have a global scope and not a class scope.
Please use the global .setup method instead:
ActiveModel::Serializer.setup do |config|
  config.embed = :ids
  config.embed_in_root = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: ** Notice: embed is deprecated. **
The use of .embed method on a Serializer will be soon removed, as this should have a global scope and not a class scope.
Please use the global .setup method instead:
ActiveModel::Serializer.setup do |config|
  config.embed = :ids
  config.embed_in_root = true
end
